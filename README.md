# JavaConsoleChessApp
Console Chess App in Java, with clean design prioritized over running time optimizations.  
To play, you need JRE (Java Runtime Environment) installed. If you can run java scripts on your machine, it is already installed. To play (on Windows), do the following:
1) Download the "ConsoleChess.jar" file (5.6 MB) in the main github directory, or by following this link: https://github.com/CBecke/JavaConsoleChessApp
2) Open the containing folder in cmd
3) type "java -jar ConsoleChess.jar"
4) Have the time of your life :)
